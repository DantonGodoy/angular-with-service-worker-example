# AngularPwaApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.23.
This project was created and built by Danton de Godoy Petri Lima and it was made for study purposes only.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Emulating the PWA behaviour

Run `ng build --prod` to make a clean production build of the app.
If not installed, run `npm i -g http-server`. This will give you a local server which you will be able to simulate a real client-server communication.

Navigate to the recent generated dist/ folder by typing `cd dist` in the terminal.
Lastly, run `http-server -c-1 angular-pwa-app/` and navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## Installing the App

On the top address bar of your browser, you will see a circled plus sign icon. Clicking on it will prompt you to install the application. Click Yes and see the magic happening.
